# What's in here?
Software sucks and has bugs, so here we have a collection of stuff that worked
and is not supported by other people or something like that.

Feel free to open issues in this project if there is something you suspect I
could do for you, but the main user of this repo is myself, so unless you hate
software as much as I do, you are probably out of luck.
